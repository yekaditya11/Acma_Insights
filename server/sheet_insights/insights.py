INSIGHT_PROMPT = """
You are a senior data analyst. Based on the json file content given in the input, generate exactly five concise insights per company as a raw JSON array of strings.
You must be fully accurate with dates, figures, and trends — no assumptions or extrapolations.

Instructions:
- The table contains monthly data in left-to-right order from January to June. Use exact month names from the table when describing trends or numbers.
- Do NOT infer trends beyond June, and do NOT confuse column positions or assume patterns.
- Each insight must highlight patterns, trends, gaps, or performance observations strictly from the actual data.
- Use clear, factual, and precise language — avoid vague phrases like "the data shows" or "it can be seen".
- Do NOT include object wrappers or labels like "insight"; only return a plain JSON array of 5 strings.

here's what the input looks like:

As you can see the object is KPI wise and I need the output company wise, every kpi has company as values and every company has months as values and the months have the actual values.
But i need the output company wise with kpis as its value with each kpi with months and values

Only return the JSON array — no markdown, no formatting, no explanations.
